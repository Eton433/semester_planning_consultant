# semester_planning_consultant
A web-based system for optimizing students' credit and time allocation.
# System Architecture

## Overall Architecture

The system is a web application composed of a frontend and a backend.

- **Frontend**: A Single Page Application (SPA) built using Vue.js. It handles all user interactions and renders dynamic views.
- **Backend**: A Node.js application using the Express.js framework. It serves RESTful APIs for data access and interacts with a MySQL database.

## Frontend Details

The frontend uses Vue.js and Vue Router for SPA navigation.

### Components (Located in `frontend/src/components/`)

- **`AbilityManager.vue`**
  - Add/update abilities with level and description.
  - Interacts with `/abilities` and `/api/student-ability`.

- **`Auth.vue`**
  - Login interface.
  - Calls `/auth/login`, stores `student_id` in `localStorage`.

- **`Dashboard.vue`**
  - Main post-login landing view. (Currently a placeholder.)

- **`PerformanceInput.vue`**
  - Students select a course and input a score.
  - Pulls courses from `/api/courses` and records from `/api/performance/:student_id`.
  - Similar in function to `StudentCoursePlanner.vue`.

- **`StudentClubPage.vue`**
  - Allows selection of clubs and displays time commitment.
  - Interacts with `/clubs/...` endpoints.

- **`StudentCoursePlanner.vue`**
  - Course planning: select course, semester, expected grade, and study hours.
  - Courses fetched from `/api/courses`, selections sent to `/students/:id/courses`.

- **`TimePlanView.vue`**
  - Displays a summarized weekly study plan (future feature).
  - Interacts with `/api/time-plan/:id`.

## Routing

Routing is handled in `frontend/src/router/index.js`.

- **Mode**: `createWebHistory` is used.
- **Routes**: `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/student`, `/abilities`, `/clubs`, `/performance`, and `/timeplan`.
- **Default Redirect**: `/` ‚Üí `/login`.

### Navigation Guard

- Checks if `student_id` exists in `localStorage`.
- If not logged in:
  - Redirect to `/login?reason=login_required`.
- If already logged in and accessing `/login`, redirect to `/dashboard`.

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

- Authentication is simple and sessionless (using localStorage).
- Navigation guards enforce route protection.
- Message prompt is shown on login page if redirected due to unauthorized access.

---

## üìö Course Selection

- Dropdown lists with `course_id - course_name`.
- User selects courses with expected grades and estimated study hours.
- Data is sent to `Student_Course_Selection`.

---

## üß† Ability Management

- Select an ability, choose a level (1‚Äì5), and add optional notes.
- Abilities are linked to each student in a relational table.

---

## üéØ Performance Entry

- Students input and update their scores.
- `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` logic allows safe re-submission.
- View all scores in a summary table.

---

## üéΩ Club Participation

- Join one or more clubs.

- Participation data stored in `participate` table.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Planning (Optional)

  - Club hours
  - Ability levels
- Returns suggested weekly time allocation.

---

## üí¨ UX Messages

- Uses in-page styled `<div>` alerts for:
  - Login required
  - Submission success/failure
  - Incomplete form warnings
- Avoids browser `alert()` popups for smoother UI.

---

## üß™ Testing Endpoint

- `GET /api/ping` returns `{ pong, timestamp }` for testing server status.
